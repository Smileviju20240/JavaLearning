Build, Build Tool and Build Process : 
1. Set of source code which is compiled and ready to test and deploy is nothing but Build.
2. To automate the build, we use Build automation tool like Ant, Maven, Gradle etc. and can use VS code, IntelliJ, Eclipse as editor.
3. Build process :  Build process is a process of converting project source code into executable file. 
                    Downloading and adding required dependencies to project Build path -> compile the source code and execute tests -> package it in Jar/War


Gradle Build Tool :

1. An Build automation tool.
2. It's advanced than Maven and written in Groovy / Kotlin language.
3. Implementing language - C++, JAVA, Kotlin, Scala, Swift
4. Testing framework - Junit, TestNg, etc.
4. build.gradle of Gradle == pom.xml of maven
6. Gradle wrapper provide the graddle run time using jar and properties file without installing gradle in other system.

                Maven                                                               Gradle
1. Older than Gradle                                           1. Newer and advanced than Maven
2. language - C/C++, JAVA, Kotlin, Scala                       2. language - JAVA, C#, Ruby
                              ****************User Compatibilty********************
3. Uses pom.Xml file in xml language for build script          3. Uses build.gradle file and in Groovy language for build script
4. CLI(To run the project) - mvn                               4. CLI(To run the project) - gradlew (OR) gradle run
5. Execute requested task, so slower performance               5. Execute all build life cycle phases, so faster performance than Maven
